## Working with Git
Each project member should make a new branch to work on stuff and then then send a pull request to merge with main
ideally stick to one branch per project member
if you are confident then use a different branch for every new feature

## Common git commands
1 look up `git status`
2 add files `git add .`
3 make commit `git commit -m "some message"`
4 push to git `git push origin branch`
5 see branch `git branch`
6 see all branches `git branch -a`
7 switch `git switch branch-name`
8 pull latest code `git pull origin branch-name`
9 stash changes `git stash`
10 pop stash `git pop`


## Project Linkes
** aways get the latest main branch and merge to your feature or personal branch before starting work
